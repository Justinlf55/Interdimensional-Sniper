## Architecture and Technologies
  + Javascript for game logic
  + Canvas for game play
  
## Implementation Timeline 
 + Day 1: Install all node packages and create an entry point.  I will try to learn the a reasonable amount about canvas,     enough to get started by the second day. 
 + Day 2: try to get enemies and obstacles render on the board and to start writing basic game logic. 
 + Day 3: Continue to work on the game logic, adding increased difficulty and a timer. 
 + Day 4: Styling and deploy game.
